    overview: |
      Our Data Operators are volunteers that receive your data submissions and
      enter the information into the Berner-Garde Database. Under the guidance
      of our File Manager, they work hard to insure that the data is entered
      accurately and completely. Health and Certification information is verified
      to insure the integrity of the database. You can submit your dog or litter
      data via the forms available on this web site or by contacting one of our
      Operators directly.
    questions: |
      If you have any questions regarding our Data Operators or would like to
      volunteer to be one yourself, please contact the Berner-Garde File Manager.
